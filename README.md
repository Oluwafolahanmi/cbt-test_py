This Python program serves as a comprehensive student admission and testing system, leveraging MySQL as the backend database. It facilitates user registration through the "reg()" function, enabling students to input personal details and generating random matriculation numbers. The "login()" function allows registered students to log in by providing their matriculation numbers and passwords, with credentials validated against the database. The "start()" function initiates the program, presenting users with options for registration, login, or exiting. Upon login, the "homepage()" function offers functionalities such as taking tests, checking results, or reviewing admission statuses. Tests conducted via the "test()" function consist of five questions, with scores updated in the database, and admission statuses determined based on scores. Additionally, students can check their test results or admission statuses through the "checkResult()" and "checkStatus()" functions, respectively. The program streamlines student management processes, providing a seamless user experience from registration to accessing various functionalities.
